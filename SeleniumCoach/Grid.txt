Selenium Grid:
--------------
Using this Selenium component, we can distribute test cases from main machine to remote
machines to save execution time and also to perform platform compatibility testing.

This needs Hub-Node architecture to be created:

Hub: is a central single machine where we build test cases
Node: is remote machine avaialble in LAN where we execute test cases. 
We can register multiple nodes to a hub.

Hub-Node can be setup using Se Grid.

Configuration of Hub:
---------------------
Go to Seleniumhq.org web site
Download Selenium Standalone Server jar file
Save in local folder
Open command prompt run below command to set up Hub:

java -jar E:\Projects\selenium-server-standalone-3.1.0.jar -role hub
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Observe that it says "Hub is up and running". Default it runs on port number 4444.
To verify it using browser, hit URL: http://localhost:4444/grid/console
				----

Configuration of Node:
---------------------
Download and save Selenium Standalone Server jar file in remote machine where scripts 
need be executed.

Open command prompt in remote machine run below command to set up Firefox Node:

java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=E:/Projects/geckodriver.exe  
E:\Projects\selenium-server-standalone-3.1.0.jar -role node 
-hub http://192.168.1.230:4444/grid/register/

Observe that node is registered and ready for use on port number 5555 by default.

We can register other nodes on different port numbers using below command:

Chrome Node:

java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=E:/Projects/chromedriver.exe  
E:\Projects\selenium-server-standalone-3.1.0.jar -role node 
-hub http://192.168.1.230:4444/grid/register/ -port 5566

IE Node:

java -jar -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=E:/Projects/IEDriverSever.exe  
E:\Projects\selenium-server-standalone-3.1.0.jar -role node 
-hub http://192.168.1.230:4444/grid/register/ -port 5577
						    ----

Execute test cases:
-------------------
1. RemoteWebDriver: This is also a class implements WebDriver interface. It's consructor 
required two parameters:
parameter1: Node address (URL class)
parameter2: platform selection on node machine
2. DesiredCapabilities: This is to select browser or OS on remote machine.
